My project is a website that I have created to Louisville Male cross country team. 

My navigation bar is responsive to the different devices. Also in mobile version the menu turns into a hamburger menu. My home page has a header image that is a slideshow. Also my body text at the bottom of the page and the footer is responsive. My schedule page is linked to the blog that the coach uses to update the schedule for the season. My contact page has responsive info boxes and button. Also another feature on the form is that it validates the input being put into the information boxes. 

Everything on my website is pretty straight forward and doesnt involve anything special to run the website.
