My project is a website that I have created to Louisville Male cross country team. 

My navigation bar is responsive to the different devices. Also in mobile version the menu turns into a hamburger menu. 

My home page has a header image that is a slideshow. Also my body text with the images are all responsive. 

My contact page has responsive info boxes and button. Also another feature on the form is that it validates the input being put into the information boxes. 

To view my project you would just need to download the project to your local machine and open index.html in your browser.
